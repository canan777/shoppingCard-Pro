🛒When the product is added to the cart, the cart will give you the price of the product. 

🛍 When more than one product is added to the cart, it will give you the total shopping amount. 

🗑 When the product is removed from the cart, it will be deducted from the total shopping amount. 

➕➖ The cart will have "+" and "-" buttons, so you can add or remove more than one of the same product.
